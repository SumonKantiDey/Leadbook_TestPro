### Prerequisites
```
python 3.7
Django

For developing backend API I have used Django python web Framework. Some reason i have choosed Django.
```
- It offers a full-featured Model-View-Controller framework
- Provide robust ORM (object-relational mapper) that helps to interact with databases
- It has excellent directory structure, dynamic CRUD (create, read, update and delete) interface and functional admin panel
- Huge third party application support

```
Table joins and views for flexible data retrieval
PostgreSQL is complete ACID compliant.
